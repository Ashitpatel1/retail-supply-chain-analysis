Ability to translate business questions into SQL logic
Understanding of retail and supply chain operations
Experience working with structured relational datasets

12. Key Business Insights

A small number of products contribute a large share of total revenue, indicating a strong Pareto (80/20) pattern.
Online sales channels generate higher order volumes compared to offline channels.
Premium and value customer segments deliver higher average revenue than budget segments.
Several products show high stock aging, highlighting potential overstock or slow-moving inventory risks.
Supplier performance varies, with some suppliers consistently achieving shorter delivery lead times.
Discounts and promotional events increase sales volume but may reduce margins if not managed carefully.

13. Business Solutions & Recommendations

Prioritize high-revenue products
Focus inventory planning, marketing efforts, and supplier alignment on top-performing SKUs.
Optimize channel strategy
Allocate more stock and promotional activity to high-performing online sales channels.
Segment-based customer strategy
Design targeted campaigns for premium and value customers to increase retention and lifetime value.
Improve inventory management
Review reorder points and reduce excess stock for slow-moving products to minimize holding costs.
Strengthen supplier relationships
Prefer suppliers with shorter lead times and better cost efficiency; reassess underperforming suppliers.
Smarter promotion planning
Use discounts strategically for clearance or event-based sales while closely monitoring profitability.

14. Conclusion

This project showcases how SQL can be used to analyze complex retail supply chain data and transform raw data into actionable business insights and solutions.
It reflects the real responsibilities of a Data Analyst working with cross-functional business teams.
